##Test

Test scene has the resolution of 1280x720 and sampling count was set at 100. The higher the sampling count, the better the output result, but the time needed to render the scene is also increased. The Ray Tracer was tested under the following configurations: 

* macOS High Sierra (Core i5-5257U 2.7Ghz): 738.74 seconds 
* Windows 10 Pro (Core i5-4200M 2.5Ghz): 1,237.54 seconds
* Ubuntu 18.04 (Core 2 Duo 2.0Ghz): 1,628.93 seconds
